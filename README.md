# Clinical_Examination_Notes

+This is an NLP project with textual data from the USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills exam, which is a medical licensure exam. This exam measures a trainee's ability to recognize relevant clinical facts in standardized patient encounters.

+My goal in this project is to develop an automated way to identify relevant features in each patient note using NLP techniques and models.

+I used transformers models in the modeling phase for their ability to achieve a high score and the speed of their training phase.

ENJOY !!!
